A simplistic speech aligner

README
---------------------------

A. Use the aligner to align a transcript with a corresponding .wav audio file 

1. Go to the directory of the aligner program.
2. type "./align.pl AUDIOFILE TRANSCRIPT" or
	type "./align.pl" to bring up hints on how to use the program.

4. Optionally, if you prefer manually mark the end of the sound file, type
"./align.pl AUDIOFILE TRANSCRIPT 1", and then follow instructions on the screen.

B. See the results.

By doing the above three steps, the program will create a directory with the 
same name as that of the sound file (so it's important to name sound files 
differently. e.g. subject1.wav, subject2.wav). Inside the directory there are
two folders named "phseg" and "wdseg". "phseg" contains the alignment results
for phonemes, whereas the "wdseg" directory contains the alignment results
for words.

A file named "annotation.eaf" records the results in an XML format (viewable
through Elan (http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/elan/), as well as any program capabale of opening XML, e.g. firefox, etc.). In future the output format will hopefully be pluggable and changeable with a command line option.

Should any problem occur, please let Ting (ting.qian@rochester.edu) or Andrew (andrew.watts@rochester.edu).
